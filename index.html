                "Caroline and I have worked together in Audible customer care for two years and during that time, she's been a strong partner to me in both of her roles.
                <br> While she was in her first role here, managing our global partners, I could always rely on Caroline to dig deep into customer issues and to drive resolutions with our outsourced partners so that we were managing customer contacts more effectively. Caroline shined when it came to evaluating data to find trends and set realistic meaningful goals for her partners.
                <br>She also took on a major project for the team, organizing our first ever vendor summit, which was lauded as a big success logistically and strategically in driving better understanding across our sites. Her reporting was prolific.
                <br>Caroline is someone who is willing to put in the hard work to reach her own goals and our business's goals. When she joined the program management team, she put together a plan for handling a large portion of our business-as-usual work, and she collaborated cross-functionally to ensure that the process and documentation created served those different teams' purposes. The effort helped in streamlining our work so much so that we were able to eliminate the need for our usual oversight, freeing up valuable time for our group to work on other things. She really is at her best when she can analyze data to help inform her proposed solution and then is given the freedom to develop her solution from end to end. She's assiduous with details and equally relentless when pursuing resolution to our big business questions or when pursuing her own self development."

                "I had the privilege of working with Caroline as my Audible Client. As my Client she was very supportive, accommodating, helpful and has a vast understanding of the Business. She is very keen to details and data analysis.
                <br>She piloted DART for Audible, created a process for it and worked with internal and external stakeholders to get it done. This DART tool is a system use to better assist our Consultants when they have queries or need further support in assisting our Customers. With this tool in place, our Consultants no longer need to stand up to look for someone to provide them support, all they should do is contact a DART Lead to assist them. This helped a lot in providing faster response and resolution to customers concerns improving handling time and customer satisfaction.
                <br>With her strong analytical skills, she has seen some gaps on one of our Channels so she put up a plan in reducing contacts to our Technical Support Channel to ensure only Technical issues will be routed to this Channel thus delivering better Service Level to issues with Technical concerns.
                <br>As a Client she does extra mile to properly communicate with us. She is on top of everything and ensures to provide immediate feedback. With her support, life at work is much easier and fruitful. I would say that Caroline is a well-connected professional that always takes the time to support anyone. With her experience and great analytical and problem-solving skills, she will add value to any company. "
